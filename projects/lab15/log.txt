Task:
Creation of classes of subject area (lab 13)
Overriding arithmetic and I/O operators (lab 15)
Overriding call and index operators (lab 16)
Creation of template classes (lab 21)


Printing custom class vectors:
(2, 3, 5) (3, 5, 11)
Acces to coordinates with operator[]:
3
Adding and substracting custom class vectors:
(5, 8, 16)
(-1, -2, -6)
operator+= and operator-= overrides
(6, 6, 7)
(2, 3, 5)
Printing custom class points:
point(0, 0, 0) point(1, 2, 3)
Adding and substracting custom class vectors to ppoints:
point(1, 2, 3)
point(-1, -2, -3)
operator+= and operator-= overrides
point(5, 5, 5)
point(1, 2, 3)
Printing custom class shapes:
shape(0, 0, 0) : (1, 1, 1) shape(0, 0, 0) : 5
Changing custom class shapes using vetors:
point(2, 1, 2) : (1, 1, 1) point(5, 6, 3) : 5
Changing custom class shapes using methods:
shape(0, 0, 0) : (3, -2, 3) point(5, 6, 3) : 8
Does point belong to shape using call operator:
point(1, 2, 3) belongs to shape
Cin in point (takes x, y, z):
